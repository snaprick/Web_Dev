        <h2 id = "post1" class = "headers">Learning HTML/CSS!</h2>
        <p>Started to learn HTML and CSS on <a href ="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Khan Academy</a>. So far I'm doing well. Then I'll go to the second <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud001">website</a>, where will I continue to study HTML/CSS</p>

        <h2 id = "post2" class = "headers">Spring semester 2022!</h2>
        <p>The first week of the new semester is over. So far so good, the schedule hasn't changed much. This semester I took a course in advanced statistics, I hope I will learn a lot there and be able to apply the knowledge that I will receive in the future. </p>

        <h2 id = "post3" class = "headers">Russian invasion!</h2>
        <p>The prospect of an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine has heightened alarm in the region, threatening to plunge the country's 44 million inhabitants further into the grips of conflict.<br>
But a move by the Kremlin would also ripple far beyond the two nations' shared border.<br>
Experts fear it could usher in a new era of uncertainty in eastern Europe, disrupt supply chains and the global economy, and force a shift in geopolitical influence that damages the credibility of the West.
